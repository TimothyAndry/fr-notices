        <SUBJECT>Alternate methods or procedures; emergency variations from requirements.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Alternate methods or procedures.</E> The permittee or licensee, on specific approval by the Director as provided by this paragraph, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The Director may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when he finds that:</P>
        <P>(1) Good cause is shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure;</P>
        <P>(2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure and that the alternate method or procedure is substantially equivalent to that specifically prescribed method or procedure; and</P>
        <P>(3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.</P>
        <FP>Where the permittee or licensee desires to employ an alternate method or procedure, he shall submit a written application to the regional director (compliance), for transmittal to the Director. The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure and shall set forth the reasons for it. Alternate methods or procedures may not be employed until the application is approved by the Director. The permittee or licensee shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization of any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of the authorization. As used in this paragraph, alternate methods or procedures include alternate construction or equipment.</FP>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergency variations from requirements.</E> The Director may approve construction, equipment, and methods of operation other than as specified in this part, where he finds that an emergency exists and the proposed variations from the specified requirements are necessary and the proposed variations:</P>
        <P>(1) Will afford security and protection that are substantially equivalent to those prescribed in this part;</P>
        <P>(2) Will not hinder the effective administration of this part; and</P>
        <P>(3) Will not be contrary to any provisions of law.</P>

        <FP>Variations from requirements granted under this paragraph are conditioned on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith with the procedures, conditions, and limitations shall automatically terminate the authority for the variations and the licensee or permittee shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of the variation. Where the licensee or permittee desires to employ an emergency variation, he shall submit a written application to the regional director (compliance) for transmittal to the Director. The application shall describe the proposed variation and set forth the reasons for it. Variations may not be employed until the application is approved, except <PRTPAGE P="162"/>when the emergency requires immediate action to correct a situation that is threatening to life or property. Corrective action may then be taken concurrent with the filing of the application and notification of the Director via telephone.</FP>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Retention of approved variations.</E> The licensee or permittee shall retain, as part of his records available for examination by ATF officers, any application approved by the Director under this section.</P>

        <P>(2) The Director will determine whether the responsible person or employee is one of the persons described in any paragraph of section 842(i) of the Act (see § 555.26). In making such determination, the Director may take into account a letter or document issued under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3)(i) If the Director determines that the responsible person or the employee is not one of the persons described in any paragraph of section 842(i) of the Act (see § 555.26), the Director will notify the employer in writing or electronically of the determination and issue, to the responsible person or employee, as the case may be, a letter of clearance which confirms the determination.</P>

The employer will retain the notification as part of his permanent records in accordance with § 555.121. The employer will take immediate steps to remove the responsible person from his position directing the management or policies of the business or operations as they relate to explosive materials or, as the case may be, to remove the employee from a position requiring the possession of explosive materials. Also, if the employer has listed the employee as a person authorized to accept delivery of explosive materials, as specified in § 555.103 or § 555.105, the employer must remove the employee from such list and immediately, and in no event later than the second business day <PRTPAGE P="166"/>after such change, notify distributors of such change.</P>

The appeal request must include appropriate documentation or record(s) establishing the legal and/or factual basis for the challenge. Any record or document of a court or other government entity or official furnished in support of an appeal must be certified by the court or other government entity or official as a true copy. In the case of an employee, or responsible person who did not submit fingerprints, such appeal must be accompanied by two properly completed FBI Forms FD-258 (fingerprint card). The Director will advise the individual in writing of his decision and the reasons for the decision.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Employees.</E> The letter of denial, among other things, will advise an employee who elects to challenge an adverse determination to submit the fingerprint cards as described above. The employee also will be advised of the agency name and address that originated the record containing the information causing the adverse determination (“originating agency”). At that time, and where appropriate, an employee is encouraged to apply to the originating agency to challenge the accuracy of the record(s) upon which the denial is based. The originating agency may respond to the individual's application by addressing the individual's specific reasons for the challenge, and by indicating whether additional information or documents are required. If the record is corrected as a result of the application to the originating agency, the individual may so notify ATF which will, in turn, verify the record correction with the originating agency and take all necessary steps to contact the agency responsible for the record system and correct the record. The employee may provide to ATF additional and appropriate documentation or record(s) establishing the legal and/or factual basis for the challenge to ATF's decision to uphold the initial denial. If ATF does not receive such additional documentation or record(s) within 45 days of the date of the decision upholding the initial denial, ATF will close the appeal.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Responsible persons.</E> The letter of denial, among other things, will advise a responsible person of the agency name and address which originated the record containing the information causing the adverse determination (“originating agency”). A responsible person who elects to challenge the adverse determination, where appropriate, is encouraged to apply to the originating agency to challenge the accuracy of the record(s) upon which the denial is based. The originating agency may respond to the individual's application by addressing the individual's specific reasons for the challenge, and by indicating whether additional information or documents are required. If the record is corrected as a result of the application to the originating agency, the individual may so notify ATF which will, in turn, verify the record correction with the originating agency and take all necessary steps to contact the agency responsible for the record system and correct the record. A responsible person may provide additional documentation or records as specified for employees in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

        <P>(i) Verify the identity of the person accepting possession for the common or contract carrier by examining such person's valid, unexpired driver's license issued by any State, Canada, or Mexico; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Record the name of the common or contract carrier (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the name of the driver's employer) and the full name of the driver. This information must be maintained in the distributor's permanent records in accordance with § 555.121.</P>

          <P>(1) Terms found in the table of distances for storage of explosive materials are defined in § 555.11.</P>
          <P>(2) When two or more storage magazines are located on the same property, each magazine must comply with the minimum distances specified from inhabited buildings, railways, and highways, and, in addition, they should be separated from each other by not less than the distances shown for “Separation of Magazines,” except that the quantity of explosives contained in cap magazines shall govern in regard to the spacing of said cap magazines from magazines containing other explosives. If any two or more magazines are separated from each other by less than the specified “Separation of Magazines” distances, then such two or more magazines, as a group, must be considered as one magazine, and the total quantity of explosives stored in such group must be treated as if stored in a single magazine located on the site of any magazine of the group, and must comply with the minimum of distances specified from other magazines, inhabited buildings, railways, and highways.</P>
          <P>(3) All types of blasting caps in strengths through No. 8 cap should be rated at 1<FR>1/2</FR> lbs. (1.5 lbs.) of explosives per 1,000 caps. For strengths higher than No. 8 cap, consult the manufacturer.</P>
          <P>(4) For quantity and distance purposes, detonating cord of 50 or 60 grains per foot should be calculated as equivalent to 9 lbs. of high explosives per 1,000 feet. Heavier or lighter core loads should be rated proportionately.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Notes of Table of Separation Distances of Ammonium Nitrate and Blasting Agents From Explosives or Blasting Agents</HD>
          <P>(1) This table specifies separation distances to prevent explosion of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based blasting agents by propagation from nearby stores of high explosives or blasting agents referred to in the table as the “donor.” Ammonium nitrate, by itself, is not considered to be a donor when applying this table. Ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate-fuel oil or combinations thereof are acceptors. If stores of ammonium nitrate are located within the sympathetic detonation distance of explosives or blasting agents, one-half the mass of the ammonium nitrate is to be included in the mass of the donor.</P>
          <P>(2) When the ammonium nitrate and/or blasting agent is not barricaded, the distances shown in the table must be multiplied by six. These distances allow for the possibility of high velocity metal fragments from mixers, hoppers, truck bodies, sheet metal structures, metal containers, and the like which may enclose the “donor.” Where explosives storage is in bullet-resistant magazines or where the storage is protected by a bullet-resistant wall, distances and barricade thicknesses in excess of those prescribed in the table in § 555.218 are not required.</P>
          <P>(3) These distances apply to ammonium nitrate that passes the insensitivity test prescribed in the definition of ammonium nitrate fertilizer issued by the Fertilizer Institute.<SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/> Ammonium nitrate failing to pass the test must be stored at separation distances in accordance with the table in § 555.218.</P>

              <SU>1</SU> Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer, Fertilizer Institute 1015-18th St. N.W. Washington, DC 20036.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>(4) These distances apply to blasting agents which pass the insensitivity test prescribed in regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation (49 CFR part 173).</P>
          <P>(5) Earth or sand dikes, or enclosures filled with the prescribed minimum thickness of earth or sand are acceptable artificial barricades. Natural barricades, such as hills or timber of sufficient density that the surrounding exposures which require protection cannot be seen from the “donor” when the trees are bare of leaves, are also acceptable.</P>
          <P>(6) For determining the distances to be maintained from inhabited buildings, passenger railways, and public highways, use the table in § 555.218.</P>

        <P>(a) Display fireworks, pyrotechnic compositions, and explosive materials used to assemble fireworks and articles pyrotechnic shall be stored at all times as required by this Subpart unless they are in the process of manufacture, assembly, packaging, or are being transported.</P>
        <P>(b) No more than 500 pounds (227 kg) of pyrotechnic compositions or explosive materials are permitted at one time in any fireworks mixing building, any building or area in which the pyrotechnic compositions or explosive materials are pressed or otherwise prepared for finishing or assembly, or any finishing or assembly building. All pyrotechnic compositions or explosive materials not in immediate use will be stored in covered, non-ferrous containers.</P>
        <P>(c) The maximum quantity of flash powder permitted in any fireworks process building is 10 pounds (4.5 kg).</P>
        <P>(d) All dry explosive powders and mixtures, partially assembled display fireworks, and finished display fireworks shall be removed from fireworks process buildings at the conclusion of a day's operations and placed in approved magazines.</P>
