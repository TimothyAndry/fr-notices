<P>
The Department of Justice is amending the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) concerning procedures and practices in connection with denials of initial applications, denials of renewals, and revocations of explosives licenses or permits. These regulations are being codified in a new part entitled, “Rules and Practice in License and Permit Proceedings.” These regulations are based upon the regulations that ATF relied upon prior to its transfer from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice. This final rule makes minor revisions to regulations governing administrative proceedings related to the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license, and the imposition of a civil fine under Federal firearms law to reference regulations under ATF authority. These revisions remove all references to statutes, regulations, positions, and other terms that are applicable only to the Department of the Treasury. These revisions reflect ATF's position as a regulatory and enforcement agency under the Department of Justice and are consistent with the regulations governing administrative hearing processes for explosives licenses and permits.

<HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
<P>
The Attorney General has delegated to the Director of ATF responsibility for administering and enforcing title I of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), Public Law 90-618, as amended, 18 U.S.C. chapter 44, relating to commerce in firearms and ammunition; and title XI, Regulation of Explosives, of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (OCCA), Public Law 91-452, as amended, 18 U.S.C. chapter 40.
<E T="03">See</E>
18 U.S.C. 926(a); 18 U.S.C. 843; 28 CFR 0.130. Under the GCA, ATF has the authority to license applicants, renew licenses, and revoke Federal firearms licenses. 18 U.S.C. 923. The OCCA, as amended by the Safe Explosives Act, title XI, subtitle C of Public Law 107-296, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (enacted November 25, 2002), authorizes ATF to provide licenses and permits to qualified applicants for the acquisition, distribution, storage, or use of explosive materials and to renew or revoke such licenses and permits. 18 U.S.C. 843.

A. Rules of Practice in Permit Proceedings (27 CFR Part 71)
</HD>
<P>
On November 25, 2002, President George W. Bush signed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296 (the Act), which divided the regulatory functions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms into two separate agencies. The Act renamed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and transferred law enforcement and certain regulatory functions to the Department of Justice. The Act also retained in the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) certain functions of the former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. The functions retained by Treasury became the responsibility of a new Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). As a result of the Act, TTB has all regulatory authority under 27 CFR part 71 and ATF therefore cannot promulgate new regulations under that part, although ATF has continued to follow the procedures set forth in part 71 to administer hearings related to the application and revocation of Federal explosives licenses and permits.
<E T="03">See</E>
28 CFR 0.133(a)(2).
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD2">B. License Proceedings (27 CFR Part 478)</HD>
<P>
Regulations that implement the provisions of the GCA are set forth in 27 CFR part 478. Subpart E of part 478 relates to proceedings involving Federal firearms licensees, including the denial, suspension, or revocation of licenses and the imposition of civil fines. Specifically, 27 CFR 478.76 provides that, at a hearing for the disapproval of applications for firearms licenses, for the denial, suspension, or revocation of a firearms license, or for imposition of a civil fine under Federal firearms law, an applicant or licensee may be represented by an attorney, a certified public accountant, or any other person recognized to practice before ATF as provided in 31 CFR part 8, if the representative complies with the applicable practice requirements of 26 CFR 601.521 through 601.527.

C. License and Permit Proceedings (27 CFR Part 555)
</HD>
<P>
The regulations that implement OCCA procedural and substantive requirements are found in 27 CFR part 555. Subpart E of part 555 relates to proceedings involving Federal explosives licensees and permittees, including the denial of an initial application, denial of a renewal, and revocation of a license or permit. Specifically, 27 CFR 555.78 provides that, at a hearing for the disapproval of applications for explosives licenses, and for the denial of renewal or revocation of such licenses or permits under Federal explosives law, an applicant, licensee, or permittee may be represented by an attorney, a certified public accountant, or any other person recognized to practice before ATF as provided in 31 CFR part 8, if the representative complies with the applicable practice requirements of 26 CFR 601.521 through 601.527.
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</HD>
<P>
On October 7, 2014, the Department of Justice published a notice of proposed rulemaking with a request for comments entitled, “Rules of Practice in Explosives License and Permit Proceedings (2007R-5P); Revisions Reflecting Changes Consistent with the Homeland Security Act of 2002.” 79 FR 60391-60405. The proposed rule sought to revise ATF regulations to add a new part that implements 18 U.S.C. 843 and 847 relating to the procedures and practice for the denials of initial applications, denials of renewal, and revocations of explosives licenses or permits by ATF under Federal explosives law. Additionally, the proposed rule sought to make minor revisions to regulations governing administrative proceedings related to the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license, and the imposition of a civil fine under Federal firearms law to reference regulations under ATF authority. These changes clarify ATF's role in explosives license proceedings and remove references to any regulations outside the scope of ATF's authority.
</P>
<P>
Comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking were to be submitted to ATF on or before January 5, 2015.
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Comment Analysis and Department Response</HD>
<HD SOURCE="HD2">Comments Received</HD>
<P>
In response to the notice of proposed rulemaking, ATF received two comments. One commenter is an explosive and fertilizer trade association; and the other is a university student. Both commenters support ATF's proposal to transfer and consolidate regulations governing explosives license applications and renewals or revocation of licenses and
<PRTPAGE P="64742"/>
permits, improving the enforcement of ATF's regulations.
</P>
<P>
One of the commenters, the Institute of Makers of Explosives (IME), notes that the creation of a new part 771 addresses jurisdictional and authority issues within ATF. IME agrees that ATF should maintain jurisdiction for all explosives programs and since the regulatory authority over part 71 resides with another agency, ATF should promulgate new regulations affecting the procedures for hearings that it is responsible for conducting. IME further states: “If promulgated, the new Part will bring all administrative and enforcement responsibilities connected with the explosives licensing and permitting program under the jurisdiction of ATF and will allow the Bureau, itself, to affect any necessary changes to the procedural rules governing its due process proceedings.” Further, IME agrees with ATF's clarification of 27 CFR 555.78 that will allow for self-representation in licensing and permit hearings conducted by ATF.
</P>
<P>
The second commenter, a student, generally supports the rule because the proscribed regulation changes will not hurt the economy but rather “help[s] the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, State, local, or tribal government and communities.” The same commenter further notes that the rule gives every person the right to due process if their application has been denied for a firearm.
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD2">Department Response</HD>
<P>
The Department agrees that by promulgating regulations in a new part, 27 CFR part 771, ATF will be able to better govern and administer explosives license and permit proceedings that come under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Final Rule</HD>
<P>
This final rule implements the amendments to the regulations in 27 CFR 478.76, 555.73, 555.75, 555.78, 555.79, 555.82, and adds new part 771, as specified in the notice of proposed rulemaking published on October 7, 2014 (79 FR 60391-60405). Additionally, this final rule includes some minor technical amendments. First, in 27 CFR 771.5, the definition of “Application” is amended to include renewal applications and the definition of “Person” is amended to include “company.” Second, § 771.59, which governs an initial application for a license or permit, is amended to eliminate the statement that a request for hearing should include a statement of the reasons for a hearing; this change makes this provision consistent with the requirements for an existing Federal explosive licensee requesting a hearing in § 771.60. Third, §§ 771.59 and 771.60 are amended to add that the licensee or permittee will receive notice of the assignment of an administrative law judge (ALJ) by the Director of Industry Operations (DIO), if the ALJ has not already provided such notice; this clarifies that the ALJ will often provide this notification but the DIO must provide this notice if not already provided by the ALJ. Fourth, a reference to § 771.59 is added in § 771.64, which concerns part of the process following a request for a hearing, to reflect the fact that requests for a hearing can be made as a result of denial of an initial application in addition to the revocation or denial of a renewal application. Fifth, § 771.82 is amended to include a statement that the Federal Rules of Evidence are not binding on these proceedings, and to include a reference to expert testimony and the relevant Federal Rule of Evidence in § 771.82(a). These changes are necessary to clarify what is admissible in a hearing and to clarify that both opinion and expert testimony shall be admitted in a hearing when the ALJ is satisfied that the witness is properly qualified pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 701 or 702. Sixth, § 771.95, which governs the responsibilities of an ALJ, is amended to eliminate the sentence that ALJs shall be under the administrative control of the Director. This sentence addresses the responsibilities of the Director and not the responsibilities of the ALJs. Therefore, the sentence is unnecessary as to the responsibilities of the ALJ and confusing as to application. Seventh, § 771.97(k), which authorizes the ALJ to take any action authorized by an ATF rule and consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, is amended to add a cross-reference to ATF's authority concerning licenses and permits, 18 U.S.C. 843, and the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act setting out authority for individuals presiding over agency hearings, 5 U.S.C. 556(c). Eighth, the final rule amends 27 CFR 771.99 to state that disorderly or contemptuous language or conduct by an attorney (either for a licensee or permittee or for the Government), may be reported to the Department of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility, consistent with 28 CFR 0.39a(a)(9). Finally, other changes eliminate superfluous language or correct stylistic errors.
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Statutory and Executive Order Review</HD>
<HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Executive Order 12866, 13563, and 13771</HD>
<P>
This final rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review,” section 1(b), The Principles of Regulation; Executive Order 13563, “Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,” section 1(b), General Principles of Regulation, and section 6, Retrospective Analyses of Existing Rules; and Executive Order 13771, “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs.”
</P>
<P>
Both Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule consolidates and clarifies regulations governing explosives license application renewal or revocation of licenses and permits. This rule would not add any costs to industry because this rule puts into regulation current industry and agency practices; therefore, the explosives industry would not need to incur any hourly or capital burdens in order to comply with this final rule. The Department has assessed the costs and benefits of this regulation and believes that the regulatory approach selected imposes no new regulatory costs and maximizes net benefits.
</P>
<P>
This final rule will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, nor will it adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal government or communities. Similarly, it does not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency, materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof, or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. The Department has determined that this final rule is not a “significant regulatory action” as defined in Executive Order 12866, section 3(f). Accordingly, this
<PRTPAGE P="64743"/>
final rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
</P>
<P>
Because this rule is not significant under Executive Order 12866, this action is not subject to Executive Order 13771, “Reducing Regulations and Controlling Regulatory Costs.”
</P>
<P>
Section 6 of Executive Order 13563 directs agencies to develop a plan to review existing significant rules that may be “outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome,” and to make appropriate changes where warranted. The Department selected and reviewed this rule under the criteria set forth in its Plan for Retrospective Analysis of Existing Rules, and determined that this rule merely transfers and consolidates regulations governing explosives license application renewal or revocation of licenses and permits, improving the enforcement of ATF regulations.
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Executive Order 13132</HD>
<P>
This final rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with section 6 of Executive Order 13132, “Federalism,” the Attorney General has determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism summary impact statement.
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Executive Order 12988</HD>
<P>
This final rule meets the applicable standards set forth in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, “Civil Justice Reform.”
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
<P>
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) exempts an agency from the requirement to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements if the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and small governmental jurisdictions. The Attorney General has reviewed this final rule and, by approving it, certifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
</P>
<P>
This final rule codifies the ATF regulations governing the procedure and practice for denying applications, denying renewals, and revoking explosives licenses or permits under Federal explosives law in a new part 771 under ATF's regulatory authority. Additionally, this final rule updates the regulations governing the denial, suspension, or revocation of a firearms license, and imposition of a civil fine under Federal firearms law to only reference regulations under ATF authority. This rule also amends the regulations to require an applicant or licensee in a proceeding concerning the denial, suspension, or revocation of a firearms license, or the imposition of a civil fine under Federal firearms law, to file a duly executed power of attorney designating his representative, and waivers, if applicable, under the Privacy Act of 1974.
<E T="03">See</E>
5 U.S.C. 552(a), and 26 U.S.C. 6103(c) (confidentiality and disclosure of returns and return information). This is required in the current regulations by reference to 31 CFR part 8 and 26 CFR 601.521 through 601.527. The changes in this final rule are purely administrative and do not add any new requirements that would have any impact on the economy.
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD2">
E. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
</HD>
<P>
This final rule is not a major rule as defined by section 251 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.
<E T="03">See</E>
5 U.S.C. 804. This final rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets.
</P>
<HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
<P>
This final rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year, and it will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.

<SUBJECT>Opportunity for compliance.</SUBJECT>
<P>
No license or permit shall be revoked or denied renewal unless, prior to the institution of proceedings, facts or conduct warranting such action shall have been called to the attention of the licensee or permittee by the Director of Industry Operations in writing in a contemplated notice, and the licensee or permittee shall have been accorded an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all lawful requirements as set forth in section 9(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act. In cases in which the Director of Industry Operations alleges in his contemplated notice, with supporting reasons, willful violations or that the public interest requires otherwise, this section does not apply and the issuance of a contemplated notice is unnecessary.

</SECTION>
<SECTION>
<SECTNO>§ 771.36 </SECTNO>
<SUBJECT>Settlement.</SUBJECT>
<P>
Any proposals of settlement should be made to the Director of Industry Operations, but may be made through the Attorney for the Government. Where necessary, the date of the hearing may be postponed pending consideration of such proposals when they are made in good faith and not for the purpose of delay. If proposals of settlement are submitted, and they are considered unsatisfactory, the Director of Industry Operations may reject the proposals and may, either directly or through the Attorney for the Government, inform the licensee or permittee of any conditions on which the alleged violations may be settled. If the proposals of settlement are considered satisfactory to the Director of Industry Operations, the licensee or permittee shall be notified thereof and the proceeding shall be dismissed.

<SUBJECT> Notice of contemplated action.</SUBJECT>
<P>
Where the Director of Industry Operations has not ascertained whether the licensee or permittee has willfully violated the Federal explosives laws and where he believes the matter has the potential to be settled informally,
<E T="03">i.e.,</E>
without formal administrative proceedings, he shall, in accordance with section 5(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, prior to the issuance of a notice of revocation or denial of renewal, give the licensee or permittee a contemplated notice of such action and an opportunity to show why the license or permit should not be revoked or denied renewal. The notice should inform the licensee or permittee of the charges on which the notice would be based, if issued, and afford him a period of 15 days from the date of the notice, or such longer period as the Director of Industry Operations deems necessary, in which to submit proposals of settlement to the Director of Industry Operations. Where informal settlement is not reached promptly because of inaction by the applicant, licensee, or permittee or proposals are made for the purpose of delay, a notice shall be issued in accordance with § 771.42 or § 771.43, as appropriate. The issuance of a notice of contemplated action does not entitle the recipient to a hearing before an administrative law judge.

        If there has been no initial conference under § 771.66, the administrative law judge may at the beginning of the hearing require that the parties attempt to arrive at such stipulations as will eliminate the necessity of taking evidence with respect to allegations of fact about which there is no substantial dispute.

        <SUBJECT>Evidence.</SUBJECT>
        <P>
        The Federal Rules of Evidence are not binding on these proceedings. However, any relevant evidence that would be admissible under the rules of evidence governing civil proceedings in matters not involving trial by jury in the Courts of the United States shall be admissible. The administrative law judge may relax such rules in any hearing when in his judgment such relaxation would not impair the rights of either party and would more speedily conclude the hearing or would better serve the ends of justice. However, the administrative law judge shall provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. Every party shall have the right to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, depositions, or duly authenticated copies of records and documents; to submit rebuttal evidence; and to conduct such reasonable cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.

        <P>
        (a)
        <E T="03">Witnesses.</E>
        The administrative law judge shall have the right in his discretion to limit the number of witnesses whose testimony may be merely cumulative and shall, as a matter of policy, not only exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence but shall also limit the cross-examination of witnesses to that required for a full and true disclosure of the facts so as not to unnecessarily prolong the hearing and unduly burden the record. Opinion or expert testimony shall be admitted when the administrative law judge is satisfied that the witness is properly qualified as defined by Federal Rules of Evidence 701 or 702.

        <P>
        (b)
        <E T="03">Documentary evidence.</E>
        Material and relevant evidence shall not be excluded because it is not the best evidence unless its authenticity is challenged, in which case reasonable time shall be given to establish its authenticity. When only portions of a document are to be relied upon, the offering party shall prepare the pertinent excerpts, adequately identified, and shall supply copies of such excerpts, together with a statement indicating the purpose for which such materials will be offered, to the administrative law judge and to the other parties. Only the excerpts, so prepared and submitted, shall be received in the record. However, the whole of the original document should be made available for examination and for use by opposing counsel for purposes of cross-examination. Compilations, charts, summaries of data, and photocopies of documents may be admitted in evidence if the proceedings will thereby be expedited, and if the material upon which they are based is available for examination by the parties. Objections to the evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds relied upon. The transcript shall not include argument or debate on objections, except as ordered by the administrative law judge, but shall include the rulings thereon. Where official notice is taken of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, any party shall, on timely request, be afforded an opportunity to controvert such fact.

The administrative law judge may, in his discretion, allow briefs to be filed on behalf of either party but shall closely limit the time within which the briefs for both parties shall be filed, so as to avoid unreasonable delay. The administrative law judge shall also ascertain whether the parties desire to submit proposed findings and conclusions, together with supporting reasons, and, if so, a period of not more than 15 days (unless extended by the administrative law judge)—after the close of the hearing or receipt of a copy of the record, if one is requested—will be allowed for such purpose.

Upon the filing in good faith by the applicant, licensee, permittee, or Attorney for the Government of a timely and sufficient affidavit of facts showing personal bias or otherwise warranting the disqualification of any administrative law judge, if the administrative law judge fails to disqualify himself, the Director shall upon appeal, as provided in § 771.120, determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the proceeding. If the Director decides the administrative law judge should have deemed himself disqualified, the Director will remand the record for hearing de novo before another administrative law judge.

<SUBJECT>Separation of functions.</SUBJECT>

Administrative law judges shall perform no functions inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities. The Director may assign administrative law judges duties not inconsistent with the performance of their functions as administrative law judges. Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as required by law, no administrative law judge shall consult any person or party as to any fact in issue unless there has been notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. The functions of the administrative law judge shall be entirely separated from the general investigative functions of the agency. No officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in any proceeding shall, in that proceeding or a factually related proceeding, participate or advise in the administrative law judge's or Director's decision, or in the agency review on appeal, except as a witness or counsel in the proceedings. The administrative law judge may not informally obtain advice or opinions from the parties or their counsel, or from any officer or employee of the ATF, as to the facts or the weight or interpretation to be given to the evidence. The administrative law judge may, however, informally obtain advice on matters of law or procedure in a proceeding from officers or employees who were not engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in that proceeding or a factually related proceeding. The administrative law judge may, at any time, consult with and obtain instructions from the Director on questions of law and policy. Furthermore, it is not a violation of the separation of functions for the administrative law judge to participate in the questioning of witnesses, where the questioning is for clarification or to move the proceedings along, and where the questioning is not so extensive as to place the administrative law judge in the position of a prosecuting officer.

        </EXAMPLE>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.</E> A person who uses a controlled substance and has lost the power of self-control with reference to the use of controlled substance; and any person who is a current user of a controlled substance in a manner other than as prescribed by a licensed physician. Such use is not limited to the use of drugs on a particular day, or within a matter of days or weeks before, but rather that the unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct. A person may be an unlawful current user of a controlled substance even though the substance is not being used at the precise time the person seeks to acquire a firearm or receives or possesses a firearm. An inference of current use may be drawn from evidence of a recent use or possession of a controlled substance or a pattern of use or possession that reasonably covers the present time, e.g., a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year; multiple arrests for such offenses within the past 5 years if the most recent arrest occurred within the past year; or persons found through a drug test to use a controlled substance unlawfully, provided that the test was administered within the past year. For a current or former member of the Armed Forces, an inference of current use may be drawn from recent disciplinary or other administrative action based on confirmed drug use, e.g., court-martial conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or an administrative discharge based on drug use or drug rehabilitation failure.</P>

    <SUBJECT>Notice of revocation, suspension, or imposition of civil fine.</SUBJECT>
    <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for action.</E> Whenever the Director has reason to believe that a licensee has willfully violated any provision of the Act or this part, a notice of revocation of the license, ATF Form <PRTPAGE P="47"/>4500, may be issued. In addition, a notice of revocation of the license, on ATF Form 4500, may be issued whenever the Director has reason to believe that a licensee fails to have secure gun storage or safety devices available at any place in which firearms are sold under the license to persons who are not licensees (except in any case in which a secure gun storage or safety device is temporarily unavailable because of theft, casualty loss, consumer sales, backorders from a manufacturer, or any other similar reason beyond the control of the licensee). In addition, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(5) and 18 U.S.C. 924(p), a notice of revocation, suspension, or imposition of a civil fine may be issued on ATF Form 4500 whenever the Director has reason to believe that a licensee has knowingly transferred a firearm to an unlicensed person and knowingly failed to comply with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(1) with respect to the transfer and, at the time that the transferee most recently proposed the transfer, the national instant criminal background check system was operating and information was available to the system demonstrating that the transferee's receipt of a firearm would violate 18 U.S.C. 922(g) or 922(n) or State law; or that a licensee has violated 18 U.S.C. 922(z)(1) by selling, delivering, or transferring any handgun to any person other than a licensee, unless the transferee was provided with a secure gun storage or safety device for that handgun.</P>
    <P>(b) <E T="03">Issuance of notice.</E> The notice shall set forth the matters of fact constituting the violations specified, dates, places, and the sections of law and regulations violated. The Director shall afford the licensee 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice in which to request a hearing prior to suspension or revocation of the license, or imposition of a civil fine. If the licensee does not file a timely request for a hearing, the Director shall issue a final notice of suspension or revocation and/or imposition of a civil fine on ATF Form 5300.13, as provided in § 478.74.</P>
